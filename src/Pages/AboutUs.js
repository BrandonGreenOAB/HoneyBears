            <p>
              For many people, the story of Honey Bear’s Cupcakery &amp; More in
              Bryson City, NC, began in July of 2022, when the cupcake shop
              first opened its doors. It’s nestled on Everett street… just a few
              strides away from the Great Smoky Mountains Railroad and The world
              famous Polar Express Train Ride. Locals come in for their daily
              dose of coffee, tea, and sweet confections, while tourists enjoy
              the same. They all browse the sprawling selection of local items
              for sale alongside the front wall while they wait for their orders
              to be fulfilled.{" "}
            </p>

            <p>
              What most people don’t know when they walk under that trademark
              black awning and into the doors of this little shop is that the
              real story behind Honey Bear’s is one of newfound love,
              heartbreak, and, just like the movies say…. adventure. That might
              sound cliche, but it’s true. Adventure is the only way to describe
              how Kim and Jeff Johner, the owners of Honey Bears Cupcakery &
              More, landed where they are today.
            </p>

            <h1>Getting Started</h1>
            <p>
              Kim always knew she wanted to do something that helped people, but
              instead of leaving for college after high school graduation like
              most of her friends, she did something different. She followed her
              family and packed up her things and moved from often-cold
              Connecticut to warm and sunny Florida.
            </p>
            <p>
              By her late 20’s, she had three young children: sons Danny and
              Brandon, and her daughter Jessica whom she affectionately calls
              “Jesse.” Soon after the birth of her daughter, the marriage
              between Kim and the kid’s father ended, and now a single mom, Kim
              was in survival mode.
            </p>
            <p>
              “My kids were everything to me,” she explains. “I had to figure
              out a way to provide for them, not just for the day or for the
              week, but for the long term.”
            </p>
            <p>
              What happened from there was a direct result of Kim’s work ethic
              and discipline. She started a carpet cleaning business using only
              an old carpet cleaner given to her by her mother. That business
              eventually grew into a commercial cleaning business and she was
              able to make just enough to support her family and put herself
              through nursing school.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Kim eventually sold that cleaning business and accepted a position
              as a Registered Nurse on a medical-surgical unit at Cape Coral
              Hospital. Eventually she transitioned into home health care; the
              hours made it easier to be home by dinnertime to be with her kids.
              At her prime in her medical career, Kim was promoted to the
              Administrator of Home Health at Gulf Coast Village. And soon after
              that came another big change to her personal life as well. The
              kids were growing up and leaving the nest, the only child left at
              home was her daughter and at 18 years of age chances are she would
              soon spread her wings. Then, Kim met a man named Jeff. He too,
              worked in the healthcare field, as a nuclear medicine technologist
              running a cardiac stress lab for many years. With lots in common
              and instantly connected, Kim and Jeff fell in love quickly.
            </p>
            <h1>The Unexpected</h1>
            <p>
              It was August of 2017. Having met the man of her dreams and now a
              grandmother to two girls, Kim’s life was falling into place in a
              way that seemed almost surreal. But it soon would shift in a
              horrific way that she could never have imagined. And it would be
              the day immediately after Kim and Jeff told each other they loved
              each other.
            </p>
            <p>
              On a Saturday afternoon, just one month after meeting Jeff, and
              just days after Hurricane Irma swept through Florida, Jesse – now
              18-years-old – was driving a pick-up truck in Cape Coral. A downed
              tree concealed a stop sign, a driver ran that stop sign and
              crashed into Jesse’s truck. Kim’s daughter was killed instantly.
            </p>
            <p>
              The unspeakable grief was like nothing Kim ever imagined. To help
              herself work through the pain of losing Jesse, Kim coped by doing
              what she knew how to do better than anything else. She worked.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              After some time went by It was time for some changes. One of which
              was marrying the man of her dreams and the man who stood by her
              side through it all. The quickly planned but beautiful wedding by
              the river, in their hometown of Cape Coral, was one for the books.
              With a good friend as the pastor and most of their family and
              friends in attendance, the two exchanged vows and then celebrated
              with everyone at a dinner reception at a friend’s restaurant.
            </p>
            <h1>The Business Beginnings</h1>
            <p>
              In May of 2018, Kim and Jeff heard about a franchise fair from
              Kim’s mom and decided to go see what it was about. Kim says it was
              as if there was a magnet pulling her to a booth with the words
              “Physical Therapy Now” splashed across the display. She knew the
              business, it was a great match. After days of discussions, it was
              settled. They were going to invest in the PT franchise for 3
              locations.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was hard work, and the businesses were successful, plus Kim and
              Jeff were both in their element, working in the healthcare field
              they both knew so well. But it was exhausting. They both loved
              being in patient care, but the time and energy it took to keep the
              business running day in and day out was taking its toll. And then
              came another setback. Jeff was diagnosed with cancer. It was
              tonsil cancer.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Treatment was grueling, and as much as Jeff wanted to be back at
              work, he couldn’t. It was six long months that he had to bow out
              of the PT business. Plus many more months of recovering.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Kim had to do it all, “ Jeff said. “She had to take over our
              personal lives, she had to take care of everything at home, and
              she had to run the business. Everything I was doing up until I got
              cancer, Kim had to take all that on too, plus everything else she
              was already doing. But as soon as I could come back, I came back.”
            </p>
            <p>
              And shortly after he did, they began talking about making another
              change. In their eyes, life was too short to do something every
              day that left them feeling depleted and unfulfilled. So, three
              years after becoming franchisees, they decided to sell the
              businesses.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              “I felt so light and free…. We didn’t know what we were going to
              do next,” Kim explained. “Jeff got cancer, and I lost Jesse. Those
              were the life-changing events that helped us realize we need to do
              something different, lighter, and more fun.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the first time in decades, Kim and Jeff were officially out of
              the healthcare business, and they were on to their next adventure.
              But this time, it was going to be sweeter than anything either of
              them had ever experienced.{" "}
            </p>
            <h1>Present Time</h1>

            <p>
              Fast forward a few years, and you’ll now find Kim and Jeff in
              Honey Bear’s Cupcakery & More, doing something they never imagined
              but somehow always wanted to do.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              “I used to joke that… I just want to pour coffee and talk to
              people. I always joked about that! And here I am,” Kim says.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, how did Kim and Jeff get here? That part of their story
              overlapped with the time when they owned the physical therapy
              business.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              After spending so many years in Florida, Kim says, “We wanted to
              get away to a mountain town. One of Jeff’s friends from college
              and her husband talk about Bryson City all the time, so we came up
              to see it and instantly fell in love.”
            </p>
            <p>
              They found a camp spot that could hold their RV all year long,
              eventually bought a 5th wheel, and found themselves driving 12
              hours from Cape Coral-Ft Myers every month to be in this charming
              little town of 1,500 people. They initially thought they would
              manage the PT business remotely if they ever decided to move, but
              Jeff’s cancer diagnosis changed those plans for the better.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              “We had dinner with a friend of ours in August 2021, and we talked
              about what we could do to support ourselves in this cute little
              town. I even remember the meal,” Kim explains. “Jeff had filet
              mignon and crab, and I had a pork chop, and there it was… Kim’s
              idea of the cupcake shop and the name Honey Bear’s - coined by
              Jeff - was born right there over dinner.”{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Soon after that, the menu came to life. The most popular cupcake
              is the Mucky Tuck Cupcake, appropriately named after the
              Tuckasegee River that runs - literally - through the middle of
              town. It has a vanilla cake and chocolate frosting and is adorned
              with chocolate curls and chocolate rocks. And then there’s the
              Blueberry Ridge Parkway, named - you guessed it - after the nearby
              Blue Ridge Parkway. It has real blueberries folded into the cake
              batter and topped with luscious frosting as well.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              And about the coffee… It's a silky & smooth roast and hailed by
              locals and tourists as some of the best coffee in town. “It makes
              for the best espressos and lattes!” said Kim clearly with a
              passion for her coffee creations.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              “It turned into a coffee and cupcake shop because you honestly
              can’t have one without the other,” Kim explained.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              But if coffee isn’t your thing, maybe the famous honey sweet tea
              will quench your thirst.
            </p>
            <p>
              And how did the location come to be? Finding that storefront at
              that time was nothing short of a miracle,” Jeff says, “And then
              nothing was to code when we moved in, there was mold in the
              insulation, and it had a drop ceiling. Those were just a few of
              the problems. It’s a very old building that hadn’t been reno’d for
              decades. It was a gut job, and the only thing original in the shop
              now is an old wood beam that runs through the center of the shop.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Jeff recalls saying one word over and over again throughout the
              process: “‘Yes.’ I just kept saying ‘yes,’” he giggles. “I had no
              idea where we were gonna live, where this cupcake shop was gonna
              go, how it was all gonna happen… but it did. I just kept saying
              yes, we put in the work, God said you need a change, and we went
              with it. I just kept saying ‘yes.’”{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              And as for the business itself: the spring and summer seasons are
              busy with hikers, bikers, campers, and tubers coming to Bryson
              City to float down the river. Fall is filled with tourists that
              locals call “leaf lookers,” and even more out-of-towners descend
              on the tiny town in the winter months for the Polar Express Train
              Ride. That’s no surprise because Bryon City was recently named The
              Best Christmas Town in North Carolina.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              The Polar Express Train Ride runs just steps from Honey Bear’s
              door, so it's perfect for passengers to stop in for a hot
              chocolate to stay warm on the cool Mountain nights. It all brings
              a unique kind of joy Kim and Jeff have never experienced.{" "}
            </p>
            <h1>A Day in the Life</h1>
            <p>
              “It’s amazing. On most days we get up early and enjoy going to the
              shop to prepare for a fun day together serving up cupcakes,
              donuts, and drinks…we love it! Our days off? We have coffee, play
              with the animals, and rest!”{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Kim and Jeff have three pets. Emma is a chihuahua that belonged to
              Kim’s late daughter Jesse. Jeff is proud to say his relationship
              with this now-senior pup is a close bond like the one Jesse had
              with her. Cali, the bulldog, is just one-year-old. And then
              there’s Pepper the cat that they found the abandoned stray kitten
              after a terrible Florida storm.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              After tending to the animals on a work day, Kim says she heads in
              to work. “Jeff’s here at 4:00 a.m. most days. He turns the ovens
              and the fryer on, and he is immediately baking cupcakes and frying
              donuts. We get a day off here and there, but when you love what
              you do, days off are just a bonus.”{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              And about those ovens… it isn’t common knowledge unless you’re in
              the kitchen, but they have names too. “Bert and Ernie” are the
              dynamic duo of commercial ovens that bake up all the yummy
              cupcakes day in and day out. The donuts are fried in a fryer named
              Fryer Tuck, and what better way to glaze those delicious
              confections other than with a glazer dubbed “Julio Eglazius.” And
              for sifting, well, the two sifting contraptions in the kitchen
              have been named “The Pointer Sifters.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The love that is rooted in this business that names its appliances
              can only be found at Honey Bear’s Cupcakery & More. It’s that new
              shop with a warm welcome that feels familiar and nostalgic, even
              though at press time (in December 2022), the business is still in
              its infancy.{" "}
            </p>
            <h1>Looking Ahead… </h1>
            <p>
              So, what does the future hold for Honey Bear’s? Kim says it’s all
              about Bryson City for now. Finally taking one day at a time, Kim &
              Jeff say they have no future plans. Yet.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Well, we love the mountain town vibe, we love Bryson City.
              There’s nothing like it. For now, we’re fully present here and
              loving every minute of the adventure.”{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              And they have a sign to prove it. Hanging on the wall in Kim and
              Jeff’s house is a sign that reads, “Agree to be Adventurous.” It’s
              a promise Kim and Jeff made to each other early on in their
              relationship, and Honey Bear’s is every bit of the adventure the
              two could have ever imagined.{" "}
